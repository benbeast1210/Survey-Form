# Survey Form 

## Overview
> This survey form template is currently set to mimic one that I would administer to the Fantasy Football league I am in. The goal with this format is to be versatile enough to suit most surveyor's needs. 

## Features
> This form is complete with 2 text fields, 1 number field, 2 dropdowns, a radio button group, a checkbox group, 2 text areas, and a submit button.

## Project Board
> Check out the project board to see the additional features I'm planning on implementing!
